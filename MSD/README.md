Magic Sparkle Donkey is an ECS or entity-component-system architecture for Swift.

## Goals
- As close to optimal memory access as practical
  - ie, components of interest can be laid out contiguously in memory
- Avoid virtual dispatch
- Not coupled to any specific renderer or type of renderer, ie could render with Metal, OpenGL, CoreGraphics, etc
- Experiment with
  - Allow component memory to be stored directly on the GPU, so you can update with a compute function

## Other libraries in Swift
### RealityKit
RealityKit has some nice things built in like PBR shaders, butâ€¦
- You can't customize shaders 

### Fireblade-ECS
Using classes ruins the point of the entt-style sparse array representation! Weird.

## TODO:
- [ ] Provide iterator to scene.forEach() that already knows the dense index, ie doesn't need to do any funny business
